# Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware

This is kurushimee's custom QMK config, adding support for PIANTORUV.

# PIANTORUV

It's my custom split mechanical keyboard based on Piantor. It works just like Piantor, has the exact same layout and positioning of keys. PIANTORUV has two left halves for both halves of the keyboard; the right half is just like the left half but flipped. The left half acts as the main half â€” I can connect either half to the PC, but the one that's connected to the PC via USB-C will always act as the left half.

# Layout

You can't use my exact keyboard config because my keyboard is the only one, but you can use my keymap on any 42-key split keyboard with 3 thumb keys on each half.

The keymap I use is named `kurushimee`. Besides lower, raise, and extend layers, it features a Plover layer emulating Gemini PR, and a gaming layer using SOCD last-input priority on strafing keys. I am also considering learning [ZipChord](https://github.com/psoukie/zipchord) and using it with this keymap, but this is just my personal thing now.

I'm using this keymap on a daily basis for everything I do with my PC. I don't switch to any other keyboards and my keymap is configured to provide me with everything I could ever need.
